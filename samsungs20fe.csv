Expandable storage is an advantage ( Not present on most of the new gen mobiles)Knox is awesomeComing to Cons:Battery is the huge disappointment.

samsungs20fe,Babu  Madgundi,1,Very poor,Never again going to buy product from flipkart. Received product already had a text message which indicates phone is tampered/used. Provided proofs but return request is unnecessarily dragged on although there is clear evidence of text message in phone. Appears like a tactics to exhaust customers and give up.
